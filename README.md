# Keyboard Commander

A small, fun, browser game to test your knowledge of using the keyboard. *No mice allowed.*

<http://thomasjbradley.github.com/keyboard-commander/>

## Why

It was developed as a test for my students, to see if they have learned two things:

1. Common keyboard shortcuts
2. How to navigate the browser without the use of the mouse
